# ExplanableAI

A Python-based project that implements explainable AI techniques by approximating clustering results using decision trees.

## Description

This project focuses on making clustering results more interpretable by using decision trees to approximate the clustering outcomes. This approach provides a more transparent and understandable way to explain how the clustering algorithm makes its decisions.

## Features

- Clustering analysis using various algorithms
- Decision tree approximation of clustering results
- Visualization of clustering and decision tree results
- Interpretable explanations of clustering decisions

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages:
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ExplanableAI.git
cd ExplanableAI
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Import the necessary modules:
```python
from ExplanableAI import clustering, decision_tree
```

2. Run clustering analysis:
```python
# Your clustering code here
```

3. Generate decision tree approximation:
```python
# Your decision tree code here
```
